Project Title: Tic-Tac-Toe Game


Project Description:

Tic-Tac-Toe is a classic game which can be played virtually anywhere. The game may appear simple on the surface, but requires strategic thinking to outsmart your opponent and be victorious! The game involves two people who alternately input X’s and O’s in a grid-like compartment, which is constructed by two vertical lines intersecting two horizontal lines. Each player is assigned a specific notation, either X or O. Each player must attempt to complete a row, column, or diagonal of three X’s or O’s before their opponent sequentially, respectively. In our version of Tic-Tac-Toe the computer will not make an attempt to win, but will select any available space at random empty grids and also the game can be played by two players at once against each other and the rules are pretty much the same.






Requirements Definition:

1. Greeting messages will be displayed in the middle of the screen.

2. Computer will ask the user to choose either “Player VS Computer”, or “Player 1 VS Player 2”. 

3. After each move an updated 3x3 grid will be displayed.

4. Display to the user that only input can only be either “X” or “O”.

5. The system should ask the first player to enter their move.

6. If the first player inputs a symbol other than “X” , the system should warn the user to not enter an invalid symbol, then allow the user to input another symbol.

7. First player can put their symbol in any place within the grid for the first move. (First player will be assigned the symbol “X”).

8. If the opponent is a computer it will pick a random space which is not taken and place an “O” symbol in it, or the system will ask the second player to enter their move.

9. If the second player enters a symbol other than “O” , the system should warn the user to not enter an invalid symbol, then allow the user to input another symbol.

10. The second player can put their symbol in any place within the grid if the place is not taken by either the first player or second player.

11. The system should ask the first player to enter their move.

12. If they enter a symbol other than “X” , the system should warn the user to not enter invalid symbol and let the user enter their move.

13. First player can put their symbol in any place within the Grid if the place is not taken by either first player or second player.

14. The game should continue with the 10th step until all the places in the grid are taken. 

15. The system should show a message containing all the places taken in the grid and “Game is Over!”
