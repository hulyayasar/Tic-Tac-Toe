Project Title: Tic-Tac-Toe Game


Project Description:

Tic-Tac-Toe is a classic game which can be played virtually anywhere. The game may appear simple on the surface, but requires strategic thinking to outsmart your opponent and be victorious! The game involves two people who alternately input X’s and O’s in a grid-like compartment, which is constructed by two vertical lines intersecting two horizontal lines. Each player is assigned a specific notation, either X or O. Each player must attempt to complete a row, column, or diagonal of three X’s or O’s before their opponent sequentially, respectively. In our version of Tic-Tac-Toe the computer will not make an attempt to win, but will select any available space at random empty grids and also the game can be played by two players at once against each other and the rules are pretty much the same.
