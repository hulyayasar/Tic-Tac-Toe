Project Title: Tic-Tac-Toe Game

Project Description:

Tic-Tac-Toe is a classic game which can be played virtually anywhere. The game may appear simple on the surface, but requires strategic thinking to outsmart your opponent and be victorious! The game involves two people who alternately input X’s and O’s in a grid-like compartment, which is constructed by two vertical lines intersecting two horizontal lines. Each player is assigned a specific notation, either X or O. Each player must attempt to complete a row, column, or diagonal of three X’s or O’s before their opponent sequentially, respectively. In our version of Tic-Tac-Toe the computer will not make an attempt to win, but will select any available space at random empty grids and also the game can be played by two players at once against each other and the rules are pretty much the same.



1.Greeting messages will be in the middle.
2.Ask user to choose either player vs computer or  player 1 vs player 2 
3.After each move an updated 3 by 3 grid will be printed.
4.System should ask first player to enter their move
5.If they enter a symbol other than “X” , the system should warn the user to not enter invalid symbol and let the user enter their move.
6.(First player must use the “X” symbol all the time). First player can put their symbol in any place within the Grid for the first move !


7. If the opponent is a computer it will pick a random space which is not taken and put “O” symbol in it or the system would ask second player to enter their move
8.If the second player enters a symbol other than “O” , the system should warn the user to not enter invalid symbol and let the user enter their move.
9. Second player can put their symbol in any place within the Grid if the place is not taken by either fist player or second player.
10.System should ask first player to enter their move
11.If they enter a symbol other than “X” , the system should warn the user to not enter invalid symbol and let the user enter their move.
12.First player can put their symbol in any place within the Grid if the place is not taken by either first player or second player.

13. The game should continue with the 7th step until all the places in the grid are taken. 

14.The system should show a message containing all the places taken in the grid and Game is Over! 

-Suggestion-
-> We can check whether first player or second player won according to their moves
But no need to put logic to computer decisions . 
-> if the player is playing with computer , we can also check who won but the computer will not make logical movements
